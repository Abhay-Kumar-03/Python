1) Counting Positive Numbers
- Given a list of numbers count how many are positive.
numbers = [1, -2, 3, -4, 5, 6, -7, -8, 9, 10]

2) Sum of Even Numbers
- Calculate sum of even numbers upto a given number n.

3) Multiplication Table Printer
- Print multiplication table for given number upto 10, but skip the fifth iteration.

4) Reverse a String
- reverse a string using loop

5) Find the first Non-Repeated character
- Given a string, find the first non-repeated character.

6) Factorial Calculator
- compute the factorial of a number using a while loop.

7) Validate Input
- Keep asking for input until a valid number is entered between (1 to 10).

8) Prime Number Checker
- Check if a number is prime or not.

9) List Uniqueness Checker
- Check if all elements in a list are unique. If a duplicate is found, exit the loop and print the duplicate.
items = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "apple", "date", "elderberry"]

10) Exponential Backoff
- Implement exponential backoff strategy that double the wait time between retries, starting from 1 second, but stop after 5 retries.
